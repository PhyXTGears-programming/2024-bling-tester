Use these functions to draw lines, draw rectangle with text, draw circle with text.
Class Rectangle:
Create instance as follows:
Rectangle(int16_t x,int16_t y,int8_t b,int8_t w,int8_t h,uint16_t bc,uint16_t fc,String txt,uint16_t tc, int8_t ts) 
where x,y are top left corner; b is the border width; w,h are width and height
bc is border color; fc is the fill color, txt is the text in the center of rectangle
tc is text color; ts is text size (1 smallest - 5 largest)
Example: Rectangle rct1(0,0,5,50,75,RED,GREEN,"abc",BLACK,2);

Class Circle:
Create instance as follows:
Circle(int16_t x,int16_t y,int8_t b,int8_t r,uint16_t bc,uint16_t fc,String txt,uint16_t tc, int8_t ts) 
where x,y are center; b is the border width; r is radius
bc is border color; fc is the fill color, txt is the text in the center of rectangle
tc is text color; ts is text size (1 smallest - 5 largest)
Example: Circle cir1(130,70,2,40,RED,BLUE,"xyz",WHITE,3);

Class Vline:
Create instance as follows:
Vline(int16_t x,int16_t y,int8_t w,int16_t l,bool lv, uint16_t lc) 
where x,y are top/left end; w,l are width and length
lv is Verical/Horizontal (true vertical, false horizontal)
lc is line color
Example: Vline ln1(65,0,5,150,true,YELLOW);
